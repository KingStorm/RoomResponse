# Room response estimation experiments

This files are results of my experiments in room response estimation. I used method described in
[Simultaneous measurement of impulse response and
distortion with a swept-sine technique](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.33.1614&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Angelo Farina.

Run evaluation.py in order to see how it works.

If I have spare time, I'll add script to actually measure the Room Response.
